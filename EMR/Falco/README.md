## Synopsis
_Falco_ is a software bundle that enables bioinformatic analysis of large-scale transcriptomic data by utilising public cloud
infrastructure.  The framework is suited to single cell RNA feature quantification analysis.

## Motivation
Computational analysis in this field has many challenges, including processing large volumes of data in the order of
tens to hundreds of gigabytes, and the use of both memory and cpu intensive computational programs.  This can be
challenging for the bioinformatician or biologist requiring the analysis, especially if resources are limited.

## Aim
The goal of this project is to provide a framework for the researcher that provides simplified, on-demand access to
computational and storage resources, as well as access to commonly used software tools required in this field.
